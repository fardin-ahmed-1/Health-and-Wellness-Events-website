### Website features

- The website's homepage features an eye-catching slider that displays multiple images or content elements in a dynamic and visually appealing way. This slider grabs visitors' attention and can be used to highlight key information or promotions.

- Within the website, there's a section dedicated to services. Instead of static content, this section uses animations to make the content more engaging. This can include animated transitions, graphics, or other visual effects that enhance the user experience.

- The services, blog, and Teams page on the website dynamically load data from a JSON file. This means that the content can be easily updated or expanded without changing the website's code. It's a flexible way to manage and display service information.

- The website includes a user account management system. This allows users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features. It's a fundamental component for services like saving preferences, accessing past interactions, or making purchases.

- To streamline the registration and login process, the website offers users the option to use their existing Google or GitHub accounts to log in. This feature simplifies the user experience, as users don't need to remember yet another set of credentials.

- In case users forget their account passwords, the website provides a convenient way to reset them. This typically involves sending a password reset link to the user's email address, allowing them to regain access to their account securely.
